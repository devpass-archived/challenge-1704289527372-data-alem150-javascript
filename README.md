# JavaScript Data Structures Challenge
In this challenge, you are required to implement two common data structures in JavaScript: Stack and Queue.

## Stack
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It has two main operations: `push` to add an element to the top of the stack and `pop` to remove the top element.

## Queue
A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It has two main operations: `enqueue` to add an element to the end of the queue and `dequeue` to remove the element from the front of the queue.

## Task
Complete the implementation of the `Stack` and `Queue` classes in the `dataStructures.js` file. The classes should have the following methods:

### Stack
- `push(element)` - Add an element to the top of the stack
- `pop()` - Remove and return the top element from the stack

### Queue
- `enqueue(element)` - Add an element to the end of the queue
- `dequeue()` - Remove and return the element from the front of the queue

## Testing
Run `npm test` to run the tests and validate your solutions.

## Setup
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
